Square dun goof'd and I wrote this to automate the Pipin/Raubahn solo duty queue, due to the constant erroring of them. 
 
Should be 100% AFKable, but if you need to customize binds - Must be done manually for the Keypad and Confirm buttons. Start button can be customized in the variables. 

I'm writing a tutorial for this, and I'll publish it soon.
